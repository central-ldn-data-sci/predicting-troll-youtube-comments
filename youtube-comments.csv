"It&#39;s not that strange, people. If you put a flat metal disk into an angle grinder you will have the same effect.<br />And if you think about it: if you cut paper with paper, then both pieces of paper will heat up the same amount due to friction <b>but</b> on the spinning disk the heat is spread out over whole circumference.<br />Simply divide the circumference of the disk by the thickness of the other paper sheet and it will give you how many times as hot the paper to be cut will get. And it won&#39;t surprise you the sheet is cut in half while the disk stays intact. This advantage is so big that you can cut thicker objects with it <i>(the wood)</i> as long as the disk doesn&#39;t get stuck.Ôªø",0,Can Paper Cut Wood?,4493775,1293,3443,55243,0,rYfkhdKcEiE

"100&#39;s of thousands of kids round the world who swim in teams competitively and dream to achieve in life just fraction of what Lochte has are just a small percentage of people that watch and look up to these sportsmen and sportswomen; they are role models and ambassadors for their sport after-all. What is he doing back in the states? In my opinion he should be stripped of his medals and banned for life from the sport as a bad role model, I guess without sponsorship now it will be tough for him to continue in the sport of swimming. If he was a Russian athlete, then I am sure that is what more people would be calling for but then I really wouldn&#39;t expect an educated middle aged person to act in that way ...but then in our liberal afraid of doing wrong by doing right society middle-class white boys tend to get exempt while others pay the price; as a minimum he should be charged for criminal damage and made to pay all expenses and serve some humbling community service in downtown Rio with the less unfortunate population of that city.

"This tribe is actually interesting. During my freshman year of college, I wrote an essay about gender norms and I used this video as a source. It&#39;s interesting how much of the modern world require women to be beautiful so that men get attracted to them. Meanwhile, this tribe turns that around as the tribal men are required by their society to meet beauty standards in order to attract the women. The accesories, make-up, dancing, and intense facial expressions that are part of gender norms today for women are actually applied to the men in their tribe. It proves that these norms are not permanent but instead are written by society that are not meant to be followed. However, this separation of gender expression is religiously followed today. If these norms are not followed, society often conclude to those who unfollow as abnormal calling them slurs such as faggot, tomboy, freak, retard, etc. This video seems likea troll video in youtube tbh, but it actually has sucha deeper meaning to it.Ôªø",0,Herdsmen of the sun - 1989 - Werner Herzog,201556,132,238,700,0,6xpiwq04bZM

"The reason why Billy is so adamant about defending him is because he is the one that brought the story to life to begin with. Billy happened by Ryan while walking on the beach and stopped to casually talk with him and shoot the breeze so to speak. During their conversation Ryan nonchalantly mentioned to him the robbery which caught Billy by surprised. Billy being the reporter that he is asked Ryan to hold off a minute while he retrieved his iPhone to video his disclosure of the incident. Billy being the journalist that he is thought it was a great opportunity to get a jump on the story not knowing that it was an embellished lie. By the time Billy realized it the interview had already gone public Thanks to Billy&#39;s swiftness and lack of research and confirmation. Basically Billy feels partly responsible for the demise of Ryan which is understandable to a point.

Just imagine if the News was actually telling us the truth.<br />Imagine the first part of this video is AL Rocher is calling out Hillary for<br />her lies.

"Android gives you options, Apple does not. The biggest loss is the games and lapsing the video which iPhone has 2 less frames but the note 7 definitely was a lot slower. To justify the Android, if you have the time to play a game you have the time to wait a little longer. Same for the video. Android is capable of so many more things with a lot of potential because of the options it gives you. Apple fanboys are people who just thrash about speed and longevity sure its fast with less ram but its because of the way the iOS runs. It is run only 1 way, the way it was built to. Android runs the way YOU want it to. If you don&#39;t need the complexity then iPhone is your best bet. Android fanboys are just people who talk about Screen resolution and more pixels whatnot.<br /><br />Basically iOS and Android are built for different specific purposes. iOS is simplicity, everything is done for you, just use the god damn phone. Android is complexity, use it the way you want it, at the cost of your battery and probably performance.<br /><br />Apple and Samsung also has different visions. It doesn&#39;t make sense to choose your phone based on speed only. Besides you westerners mostly live life so slowly anyway, why the rush? No reason to throw shade at the phone which nobody forced you to buy. We can like whatever we want to like but people will never understand. We will always think that something is better and of course YOUR opinion is always the right opinion. Human nature...intelligent yet mindless animals.

"The only reason why the iPhone 6S has managed to hold onto it&#39;s title as &quot;Fastest Phone&quot; is because Apple manufactures their own operating system and devices. The hardware difference between each phone is fairly minimal, and there&#39;s only really 1 line of device they have to cater for. Whereas Android has to be optimized for various devices, each sporting a variety of different hardware from dual core CPUs to octa cores, 1 gig of ram to 4, Apple only really caters for their iPhone line (excluding iPod and iPad, but they&#39;re basically all the same but smaller, larger, or without mobile capabilities). Because Apple know EXACTLY what hardware they&#39;re catering for, how it should work etc, they&#39;re able to optimize it much better than Google does with a whole host of devices. Granted, Google has done very well to make Android work as well as it does on a wide variety of devices. <br /><br />Also hence why older devices, like the iPhone 4, slow up with updates, gradually slowing to a crawl on such versions like iOS 7. iOS 7 wasn&#39;t designed to run on the iPhone 4, so doesn&#39;t have the necessary optimization. You may be thinking &quot;Well why would they release it for a phone that can&#39;t run it?&quot;. Well, 1 big reason is... forced-upgrade. Your phone becomes lackluster on performance, soon becoming redundant. You can&#39;t downgrade without modding the software, of which a basic user may not know how to do. The performance soon becomes an annoyance, thus you set out to upgrade your phone, bringing money to Apple. There&#39;s more reasons, but I feel that one plays a big role.<br /><br />Edit: I also feel the need to mention that this test is invalidated for the iPhone&#39;s 2nd lap as the applications weren&#39;t closed before starting lap number 2. The iPhone doesn&#39;t need to reload the applications, thus making for faster loading and hence why it caught up quickly.Ôªø",0,Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Speed Test,543649,1327,2995,6268,0,3-61FFoJFy0

"This video is not exactly an accurate representation of the Galaxy Note 7‚Ä≤s performance.<br /><br />Granted that the Galaxy Note 7 isn‚Äôt as snappy as some of the other Android flagships but do bear in mind that Apple does a lot of work to optimize its hardware and software so that they work together almost perfectly. That‚Äôs not the case with Android devices so they are already at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to overall system optimization.<br /><br />This speed test doesn‚Äôt cover some of Samsung‚Äôs genuinely useful features like split-screen multitasking or the S Pen‚Äôs Glance feature which are great for productivity as they enable users to use two apps side-by-side. The speed test doesn‚Äôt indicate the handset‚Äôs real-world performance as nobody is going to open 14 apps and render a video in the same exact sequence. What it does show is that performance is not a numbers game, optimization of software and hardware is much more important than the additional gigs of RAM a smartphone might boast.Ôªø",0,Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Speed Test,543649,1327,2995,6268,0,3-61FFoJFy0

"People that like Android want pc on a phone. Why do you want antivirus, task manager, and maintenance crap on your phone? On iPhone you don&#39;t need to worry about any of that. I&#39;m fine with iPhone multitasking. I can watch videos and listen to music while doing something else and that&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t need to ever kill apps or worry about memory usage. I don&#39;t care about how man GB of memory I got. The phone always runs smoothly. Also on Android you can&#39;t even trust the app you download to be secured.<br /><br />So as of right now Apple is superior at optimization, security, longevity (updates for older phones, lack of maintenance, app quality, and in general the quality of the user experience.<br /><br />Samsung has a far nicer screen, widgets on the homescreen, a pen, and that&#39;s it.Ôªø",0,Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Speed Test,543649,1327,2995,6268,2,3-61FFoJFy0

"Nothing new here Apple devices have always been a beast performance wise. I have family members still using iPhone 4s and it runs like the day it was unboxed. Galaxy S3 is nonexistent at this point. Even my mother in law with an S6 is painfully buggy and slow.<br /><br />On the other hand Samsung is the king of display. That screen alone has tempted me to switch. And at this point after being a huge Apple enthusiast since the iPhone 3GS, original iPad, MacBook Pro, and Apple TV, I&#39;m seriously thinking of switching. Not just the screen, but I&#39;ve grown bored of iOS home screen. We seriously need something to jazz it up.

The Mourinho of 2005 to 2010 would have probably picked Maldini as a full back and put in two of the other three CBs. However,  Guardiola would have selected Roberto Carlos because he wants more offensive full-backs<br /><br />Midfield is very difficult and I have to say my midfield is not really balanced since none of them can defend well.<br /><br />But I would go for <br /><br />Cruyff,  Zidane and Xavi.<br /><br />I think in midfield it very hard to make decisions. I mean<br />Zico is not in it,<br />Gullit is not in it, Laudrup is not in it, Scholes is not in it, Iniesta is not in it, Seedorf is not in it,<br />Pirlo is not in it.<br />Thereotically I could even use Maradona there<br /><br />But I need him in my front three which is in my opinion the best there ever was.

"I am quite surprised at the negative comments about Trudeau in this forum.  I do understand how he can be viewed in a certain light, as he is so radically different from  other leaders. We need to remember a few things: 1. in this fear mongering, fear laden world, we need someone like him right now 2. he is bringing people together.  Is divisiveness what we want? 3. Being so different, Trudeau is setting example to the world about what type of leader people now need- one who is about humanity.  Perhaps other leaders will take example and adopt some of his traits. It takes someone who is at the opposite end of the spectrum to bring things back to the balanced center.Ôªø",0,Trudeau says the Tragically Hip is 'anchored in Canada',155654,454,416,632,0,cWPcZBooIdk
